    content: "## The Challenge\n\nFood banks operate on tight margins with perishable goods. Tracking incoming donations, managing expiration dates, and coordinating distributions across multiple locations required a more robust solution than their existing spreadsheet-based system.\n\n## Our Approach\n\nWe worked closely with warehouse staff to understand their daily workflows. The key insight was that any solution needed to work on mobile devices in the warehouse, not just desktop computers in the office.\n\n## The Solution\n\nWe built a progressive web app that works offline and syncs when connected. Staff can scan barcodes to log incoming donations, the system automatically tracks expiration dates and sends alerts, and distribution centers can request inventory through the app.\n\n## Impact\n\nSince deployment, the food bank has reduced food waste by 23% and cut inventory processing time in half. The system now tracks over 2 million pounds of food monthly.",

Nonprofits can post opportunities and review volunteer applications through a dashboard.\n\n## Impact\n\nVolunteer retention has increased by 40% since launch, and nonprofits report higher satisfaction with volunteer matches.

Clients can upload documents by taking photos, receive case updates via text message, and schedule appointments through a simple calendar interface.\n\n## Impact\n\nClient communication response times decreased from days to hours.
